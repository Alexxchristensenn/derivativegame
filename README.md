# derivativegame
A web-based (HTML, CSS, JS) calculus skill development game! Users are given a function, and must enter its derivative before the timer runs out. Every 10 problems is a "challenge" problem, where the user has unlimited time but only one attempt to solve the derivative correctly. Enjoy!
